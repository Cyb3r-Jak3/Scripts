# Cloudflare DNS Management
 
 This is a script that uses Cloudflare's API to create DNS records. At somepoint I will add more features.
 
###### Requirements: python3 and requests.
 
 
## To use
Download main.py and optional is info.example.py.  
 -   If need to rename info.example.py to info.py. It allows you to store the credentials needed. Otherwise it will prompt you.
   
You can either use your global API key in auth_key or use an API token.
